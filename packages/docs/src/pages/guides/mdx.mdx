# MDX

[MDX][] is a format that allows you to write content in markdown and import and use React components inline.
It's an excellent format for documentation, blogs, or other forms of structured content.

<Note>

This guide is a work-in-progress.
If you'd like to help make this better,
please open an issue or pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/streetwriters/rebass).

</Note>

Rebass components can be imported and used directly in MDX documents,
which lets you apply styles inline to sections of your page.
Since the `sx` prop is built into the components, this can be a quick way to apply one off styles or create custom components like callouts and note boxes.

In the following example, the Box component is used to add a callout style box around its contents.

```md
import { Box } from 'rebass'

# MDX Example

<Box
color='primary'
bg='muted'
p={3}
my={5}

>

> ”This is an important quote.”

</Box>
```

You can also use the `sx` prop with child selectors to dramatically change the layout of MDX content.

```md
import { Box } from 'rebass'

# MDX Example

<Box
sx={{
    ul: {
      listStyle: 'none',
      display: 'grid',
      padding: 0,
      gridGap: 3,
      gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(auto-fit, minmax(128px, 1fr))',
    },
    li: {
      fontWeight: 'bold',
    }
  }}>

- This is a list
- Displayed in a grid layout
- With custom styles
- Pretty cool, huh?

</Box>
```

If you make repeated use of a particular layout block, consider moving it to its own component that can be imported in multiple MDX documents.

<Note>

If you'd like to style the markdown elements with the same theme object and a similar API to Rebass,
use the [Theme UI][] library, which includes first-class support for styling MDX content.
