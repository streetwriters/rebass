# Using Rebass without Context

If you'd like to use Rebass components without adding a theme to React context,
you can pass a `theme` object as a prop to any of the components.

<Note>

This guide is a work-in-progress.
If you'd like to help make this better,
please open an issue or pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/streetwriters/rebass).

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Box } from "rebass";
import theme from "./theme";

export default (props) => <Box {...props} theme={theme} />;
```
